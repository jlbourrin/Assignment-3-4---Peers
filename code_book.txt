This code book modifies and updates the original codebooks for the assignment.
It describes data from both tidy_table.txt and its aggregated view tidy_table2.txt

Feature Selection 
-----------------

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
NOTE: the dataset does NOT include meanFreq(): mean frequency

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is displayed at the end of this file.



TIDY_TABLE2.TXT
===============

tidy_data2.txt is a summary view of tidy_data.txt:
- columns are the same as in tidy_data.txt
- measurements are now grouped first by subjects and then by activities
- data are the average of the variables in tidy_table.txt
